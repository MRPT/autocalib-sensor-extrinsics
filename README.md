# Automatic Calibration of Sensor Extrinsics 

## Overview
An end-to-end application with a graphical user interface for easily calibrating the extrinsics between range and visual sensors.

Specifically, the app can calibrate the extrinsics of RGB-D cameras, 3D LiDARs, and any combination between them or with RGB cameras. Automatic and target-less calibration algorithms based on plane-matching and line-matching have been integrated into the app, allowing the calibration to be performed in any generic scene setting without the need for any specific targets. The app allows visualizing the data and tuning the parameters through a GUI at each stage of the process, thereby easing calibration efforts.

### Includes 
* A Qt-based GUI for integrating all the steps of the calibration process - raw data inspection, selecting sensors and grouping observations, feature extraction and matching, results visualization, iterative reruns with different parameters and algorithms - all into one app.

* An implementation of the calibration from planes algorithm[[1]](#references) for calibrating range sensors (RGB-D cameras and 3D LiDARs), and integrated with the GUI. This includes plane extraction and matching, and least-squares minimization of the geometric cost function.

* An implementation of the calibration from lines algorithm[[2]](#references) for calibration range sensors with RGB cameras, and integrated with the GUI. This includes 2D and 3D line extraction and matching, and least-squares minimization of the geometric cost function.

* Well structured code using OOP principles, and with detailed documentation to encourage more contributions. The core algorithms are written independent of the GUI so they can also be potentially run from the command line, independent of the GUI.
